	<p>I am currently attending my second year here at OTC. I am currently attending OTC to get an Associates Degree in Compter Science. </p>
	<p>I was born in Fayetteville, Arkansas and moved here back in 2017. So far I have really enjoyed my time here within Missouri.</p>
	<p>I enjoy taking my drone out and flying it around. I do this recreational and just for fun. </p>
	<p>I hope to learn more about every one in class!</p>
